# Time Series Analysis with Seaborn

Welcome to the Time Series Analysis with Seaborn repository! This collection of scripts focuses on leveraging Seaborn for time series visualization and analysis. The primary dataset used in this project is from 'LST_day.csv', where time-based temperature data is explored.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Loading and Exploring the Dataset

- **Load Dataset:** Utilized Pandas to read the 'LST_day.csv' file and explored the dataset using `df.head()`.

### 2. Time Series Line Plot with Hue

- **Time Series Line Plot:** Created time series line plots using Seaborn to visualize temperature trends over time.
- **Line Plot with Hue:** Implemented line plots with Seaborn, differentiating temperature trends by 'KGISWardID'.

### 3. Ward-wise Analysis

- **Ward-wise Mean Calculation:** Calculated mean temperatures per ward using Pandas groupby operations.
- **Top 3 Wards:** Identified the top 3 wards with the highest mean temperatures.
- **Filtered Time Series Plot:** Generated filtered time series plots for the top 3 wards, distinguishing them by 'KGISWardNa'.

## Usage

Explore each script independently to understand the power of Seaborn in time series analysis. Code snippets and explanations are provided to aid your understanding. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code for further learning.
